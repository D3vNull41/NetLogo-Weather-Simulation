# NetLogo-Weather-Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Proof of Concept for a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system developed using NetLogo. The project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of simulating weather phenomena, such as rain, and its impacts on crop yield.

## Features

- Simulates basic meteorological parameters including temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- Models the effects of weather phenomena like rain on crop yield.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for visualization and parameter input using NetLogo's graphical capabilities.

## Requirements

- NetLogo software installed (version 6.3 or higher).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `NetLogo-Weather-Simulation.nlogo` file using the NetLogo software.
3. Adjust simulation parameters as desired using the graphical interface.
4. Run the simulation to observe weather phenomena and their impacts on crop yield.
